# Nanite: A Kotlin DI Library

[![Experiment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Experiment-8A2BE2.svg)](https://github.com/avatsav/di-why)

> **Note**: This library is not intended for production use. It was built as an educational exercise to deepen
> understanding of advanced Kotlin features and code generation.

## üìù Overview

Nanite is an experimental dependency injection library for Kotlin, created primarily for academic purposes to explore
code generation techniques with Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP). This project serves as a learning tool to understand the
internals of dependency injection frameworks, annotation processing and code generation in the Kotlin ecosystem.

üìö Check out the [documentation](https://avatsav.github.io/di-why) for more details.

### ‚ú® Inspiration

This project was inspired by the excellent blog
post [DIY Your Own Dependency Injection Library](https://blog.p-y.wtf/diy-your-own-dependency-injection-library), which
demonstrates how to build a simple dependency injection system from scratch.
