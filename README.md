# DI-Why: Kotlin Dependency Injection Library

[![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Experimental-8A2BE2.svg)](https://github.com/avatsav/di-why)

## 📝 Overview

DI-Why is an experimental dependency injection library for Kotlin, created primarily for academic purposes to explore
code generation techniques with Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP). This project serves as a learning tool to understand the
internals of dependency injection frameworks and annotation processing in the Kotlin ecosystem.

> **Note**: This library is not intended for production use. It was built as an educational exercise to deepen
> understanding of advanced Kotlin features and code generation.

## ✨ Features

- Annotation-based dependency injection
- Compile-time code generation via KSP
- Constructor injection support
- Simple, readable generated code
